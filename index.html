        <p class="lead mb-5">My name is Tarang Desai, and I am Indian by birth. I am a very enthusiastic person and love to take part in all kind of activities. I have a very good sense of humour and am considered funny kind of guy. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from Institute of Technology and Management Universe from Gujarat, India. I am a tech loving person and love to keep myself with the latest stuff in the market. And also a little bit of business skills are in my blood as Gujaratis are considered to be the most money minded and business oriented people.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">I then moved to Canada for further education and took a course in IT Business Analyst. From this, I can be a Business Analyst with a hint of IT because of the IT background. I am a workaholic person and love to work and get bored if there is nothing to do. The only motivation I need to do any kind of work is money. I am a very money minded person and because of that I have a lot of professionalism and punctuality in me.</p>
		<p class="lead mb-5">I love to travel and specially I love road trips that are unplanned as it keeps the enthusiasm up and I like to binge watch TV series. In TV series, I like crime related series where there is too much planning and suspense which keeps the brain working.</p>

			<p>I worked at New World Recruiter as a Technical Recruiter and a Business Developer. This company was a staffing agency and took contracts from other companies who needed employees to work for them. So, we used to find suitable candidates from Indeed, Monster and other websites for them and get them ready for the interview. This was the work of Technical Recruiter. As a Business Developer, we had to convince other companies who needed employees to work with us and let us find them good and suitable employees to work for them.</p>
			<p>So, in here, I started as a Technical Recruiter and helped many people to find jobs with the companies we had tied up with and I was very good in finding the right candidate and getting them ready for the interview.</p>
			<p>Then I was transferred to the Business Development team, where I had some hurdles in the start to get a grip of, but it was just a matter of time I got into the role and excelled in it.</p>
		    <p>Also when I was studying, I worked as a delivery partner for a very well known food delivery organization call Zomato. There I used to work as a part time and the role was to pick up the food from the restaurent and deliver it to the customer in a particular time period and there was not a single day I was late anywhere.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Organizations You Want To Join</h2>
        <p>My dream is to work for Google. But to be fair there is no particular organization that I can think of to work for, but I can identify the environment I would like to work in. So there should be a peaceful and calm environment where nobody puts pressure on the other person and everyone is responsible for their own work. It should be like we can come on our time and leave on our time. Should be like an open office, but the work should be completed on time and there should be some kind of strict action if the person does not feel responsible for their work and does not complete their work on time. But as I got more and more experienced the only organization, I want to work for is my own. I would love to start a tech related company as I am a techie kind of a person and because of my expertise in Business Analyst and my skills to be a Project Manager, I want to open a company with a mixture of both as I get to play the roles of both the things I like. Also, I would keep the same kind of environment as I like in my company and no one will be forced to work but they should feel responsible enough and complete it by time however they want to do.</p>
